    <h4> A big robotics competition </h4>
    Initially solely standing for "Robot Soccer World Cup" in 1996, the RoboCup is become an international competition solving for human-centered autonomous behaviors. It is structured into 6 majors leagues and various subleagues which focus on topics such as playing soccer and providing assistance to humans in their home.
    <h4> Some numbers </h4>
    In 2017, the competition took place in Nagoya, Japan, where 50 countries were represented and a total of 500 participants were distributed between the existing leagues, each competing for first place in their own field! Below is a proud picture of our team, UT Austin Villa!
